# Xol-metrix

<img src='Doc/images/full_render.png' width=850 />


This is a filament cutter designed around the Xol 2 platform thanks to everyone that helped with the BETA process to get this project into a phase that I am comfortable in calling a released state. There will still be some small adjustments I will make when more feedback is given.

I will support the next iteration of Xol 2 when DW Tas has put it into a released state.

I do ask that if anyone makes any mods let me know so we can discuss if it makes since to put it in the repo.

So far the project supports the following.

### Hotends

- Dragon SF/UHF/ACE
- NF-Crazy
- Rapido SF/UHF
- Revo Voron
- Bambu Labs *In BETA since official XOL 2 doesn't really support it yet*

### Extruders

- [Wrist Watch G2](https://github.com/tetsu97/WristWatch-G2-Extruder)
- [Sherpa Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder)
