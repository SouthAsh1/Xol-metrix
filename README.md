# Xol-metrix

<img src='Doc/images/full_render.png' width=850 />


This is a filament cutter designed around the Xol Toolhead platform thanks to everyone that helped with the BETA process to get this project into a phase that I am comfortable in calling a released state. There will still be some small adjustments I will make when more feedback is given.

Now supports current version of Xol Toolhead! CAD included.

Does support non-heatset version of Xol, however, the cutting arm mount still requires it. So anything that is non-heatset does not require heatsets asside from that.

I do ask that if anyone makes any mods let me know so we can discuss if it makes since to put it in the repo.

So far the project supports the following.

### Hotends

- Dragon SF/UHF/ACE
- NF-Crazy
- Rapido SF/UHF
- Rapido V2 SF/UHF
- Revo Voron
- DropEffect XG
- Bambu Labs

### Extruders
